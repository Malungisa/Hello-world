# About Malungisa
I am a luther Collge graduate with a major in data science and minor in mathematics. I enjoy working on data science projects and anything related to data cleaning, visualization and analysis. I have experience working on excel, python and R but am also interested in learning new and using new tools and languages.

Reasons for this website:
- To share projects that I have worked on and currently working on.

# TEAM PROJECTS

## 1. Predicting Overall Rating of Fifa 19 Players

●	Collaborated with two group members to make a multiple regression model in R, and use statistical tools for analysis.

●	Applied the method of removing least significant predictors using p-values

●	Utilized stepwise regression

●	Produced results documenting the most significant predictors for a player's overall rating

## 2. IMDB Movies Reviews Analysis

●	Partnered with a class member to analyze a kaggle dataset about IMDB movie reviews

●	Utilized data visualization with python using tools like pandas in Watson Studio.

●	Incorporated model building using; simple and multiple regression and clustering using KNN

●	Communicated results to other students and professors through a formal presentation

## 3. Classification of Five different hand postures

●	Partnered with a two class members to analyze a UCI Machine Learning dataset about Hand Posture Classification. 

●	The problem that we attempted to tackle was accurately classifying hand posture positions based on a series of coordinates. 

●	The use of machine learning to determine hand posture can have a number of real world applications, including sign language recognition.

●	We used SGD classifier and descision tree machine learning algorithms to make predictive models. PCA was applied to reduce number of components.

●	The descision tree produced the best model accuracy with a score od 96%.

●	Models ran after PCA reduction had better performance overall.

●	The OvO models performed the best when using the SGD Classifier compared to OvA models.

## 6. Fruit Recognition

●	The problem that we attempted to tackle was accurately recognizing fruits based on images, which were taken over a 6 month period. To solve this problem we used a Convolutional Neural Network model. We also created a classical machine learning model for comparison of results

● The data used for this analysis contained 44,406 images with 15 different fruit labels. images were taken with different poses, number of fruit, same color but different fruit, different color - same category, and different lighting conditions. We also reduced the amount of images by randomly removing images from each category.

● The deep learning model (CNN) 98% performed better than the classical machine learning model (SGD classifier) 77%.

● Little difference in accuracy between color and grayscale.

## 5. Simulating Transmission of COVID-19

●	Worked with a partner to simulate and compare effects of reducing number of contacts to reducing the strength of contacts, to the spread of COVID-19

●	Simulating transmission of the infectious disease on Networks was done with Net Logo on IONTW1.1

●	Presented findings and answer questions about the project.
