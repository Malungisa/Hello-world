# About Malungisa
I am a student at luther Collge with a major in data science and minor in mathematics. I enjoy working on data science projects and anything related to data analysis. I enjoy working on python and R but am also interested in learning new and using new tools.

Reasons for this website:
- To share projects that I have worked on and currently working on.

# TEAM PROJECTS

## 1. Predicting Overall Rating of Fifa 19 Players

●	Collaborated with two group members to make a multiple regression model in R, and use statistical tools for analysis.

●	Applied the method of removing least significant predictors using p-values

●	Utilized stepwise regression

●	Produced results documenting the most significant predictors for a player's overall rating

## 2. IMDB Movies Reviews Analysis

●	Partnered with a class member to analyze a kaggle dataset about IMDB movie reviews

●	Utilized data visualization with python using tools like pandas in Watson Studio.

●	Incorporated model building using; simple and multiple regression and clustering using KNN

●	Communicated results to other students and professors through a formal presentation

## 3. Classification of Five different hand postures

●	The problem that we attempted to tackle was accurately classifying hand posture positions based on a series of coordinates. 

●	The use of machine learning to determine hand posture can have a number of real world applications, including sign language recognition.

●	We used SGD classifier and descision tree machine learning algorithms to make predictive models. PCA was applied to reduce number of components.

●	The descision tree produced the best model accuracy with a score od 96%.

●	Models ran after PCA reduction had better performance overall.

●	The OvO models performed the best when using the SGD Classifier compared to OvA models. 

## 4. Simulating Transmission of COVID-19

●	Worked with a partner to simulate and compare effects of reducing number of contacts to reducing the strength of contacts, to the spread of COVID-19

●	Simulating transmission of the infectious disease on Networks was done with Net Logo on IONTW1.1

●	Presented findings and answer questions about the project.
